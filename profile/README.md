**Infrastructure for AI Agents**

As AI agents enter the real world at scale, they will increasingly participate in and shape our economic systems.

We operate as a small systems lab. Our team consists of engineers and researchers who have designed and studied AI agents across diverse domains.

At Dunia Labs, we are focused on two core questions:
- How AI agents can solve increasingly complex problems with elegance
- How they can do so safely, within clearly defined boundaries

## Peta

**Peta** is infrastructure for production AI: an operations and permissions layer that developers can integrate directly into their existing stacks.
